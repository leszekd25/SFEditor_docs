# Lua Decompiler 4.01
SpellForce uses **Lua 4.01** as its scripting language. However, all scripts bundled with the game are compiled to shorten loading times and save file sizes. SpellForce Editor comes with a decompiler which can decompile these scripts.

## User interface

## Decompile file
Select files (one or more). Decompiler will attempt to decompile selected files.

## Decompile directory
Select directory. Decompiler will find all Lua scripts in directory and its subdirectories, and attempt to decompile them.

## Decompilation process
Decompiler will signalize how many files were successfully decompiled, and how many of them it wasn't able to decompile. If a decompilation attempt is successful, a decompiled version of file XXXX.lua is created, named XXXX_d.lua.
